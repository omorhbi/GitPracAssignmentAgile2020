[The Rise of the Software Engineer](https://smartasset.com/retirement/the-rise-of-the-software-engineer)

This is a great article since it highlights the growing need for Software Engineers in today's market. I never realized just how high the salary was for software engineers, especially when considering the lower education requirement in comparison to other fields. This article makes me wonder if it is common for people today to shift their careers into software engineering. The amount of return for investment in this field seems extremely desirable. It also makes me wonder if there will ever be an oversaturation of software engineers in the future.

Nice article, I do think that the pivot to software engineering across many undergrads is an interesting one. Many theorize that the bubble will eventually pop, but if this article is any indicator, we are likely just in the infancy of what this discipline has to offer.

This article is really interesting because it goes into some depth about the need for software engineers and how this need is increasing steadily year after year. While reading it, I couldn't help but to wonder, is there ever going to be a point where the demand for software engineers surpasses the number of people willing to do the work? Or will the pay grade of software engineers always be enticing enough for people to come into this field.
